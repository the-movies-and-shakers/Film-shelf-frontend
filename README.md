# Film Shelf

This application allows users to rate and track the films that they watch, as well as adding a rating and a genre. It was created as a group project as part of the BBC Step into Tech course.


# The Application
A text entry box to add the film title
Rate your film out of five stars â˜†
Choose a genre from a drop down menu
Add the film to a table that displays all watched films
Option to delete films from the list (in case of any embarrassing viewing choices)
